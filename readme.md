## Things what we do

1. Install node
2. Install VS CODE

3. Checked how http server endpoints work (Rendering html pages)
4. Checked how API REST Works

5. We checked how JS works in both environments

   - JS in server with node
   - JS in browser (vanilla js)

6. Frontend | created DOM elements with vanilla JS
7. Frontend | consumed an REST API with fetch, and create rows based on data
8. Created a counter with vanilla JS, event listener, based on events
